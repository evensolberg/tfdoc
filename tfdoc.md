# Usage

You may want to put the binary somewhere in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
Usage: `tfdoc [-t] [PATH]` .. The `-t` outputs things in table format rather than list. If no `PATH` is supplied, `./` is inferred.

If you have `# Title: blah blah` at the top of one of the `.tf` files, that becomes the `# Title` in the output.
